Unsupervised learning 
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns patterns and structures from data without labeled outputs. Unlike supervised learning, which relies on labeled data to train a model, unsupervised learning identifies hidden patterns, clusters, and relationships within the dataset.

Types of Unsupervised Learning

1. Clustering – Grouping similar data points together

Algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN

Example: Customer segmentation in marketing



2. Dimensionality Reduction – Reducing the number of features while retaining important information

Algorithms: PCA (Principal Component Analysis), t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), Autoencoders

Example: Reducing the number of features in high-dimensional datasets



3. Anomaly Detection – Identifying unusual patterns or outliers in data

Algorithms: Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM

Example: Fraud detection in banking transactions



4. Association Rule Learning – Finding relationships between variables in large datasets

Algorithms: Apriori, FP-Growth

Example: Market basket analysis (e.g., "People who buy bread often buy butter")




Applications of Unsupervised Learning

Customer segmentation in marketing

Anomaly detection in cybersecurity and fraud detection

Recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix, Amazon)

Image and speech recognition

Feature extraction and preprocessing in AI models
